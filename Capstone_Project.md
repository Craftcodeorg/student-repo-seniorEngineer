Capstone Project Title: Developing a Predictive Maintenance System for Aircraft

Project Description:
Create a comprehensive predictive maintenance system that utilizes real-world aircraft data to forecast maintenance needs and enhance safety measures. The project will involve collecting, cleaning, and analyzing historical maintenance data, developing predictive models, and visualizing the results through an interactive dashboard. The final deliverable will include documentation outlining the methodologies used, insights gained, and recommendations for implementation within an aerospace organization.

Key Components:
- Collect and preprocess real aircraft datasets (available through mentorship or industry partnerships).
- Develop predictive models using machine learning techniques.
- Create visualizations to communicate findings effectively.
- Present the project to peers and industry professionals, demonstrating the potential impact on aircraft performance and safety.
