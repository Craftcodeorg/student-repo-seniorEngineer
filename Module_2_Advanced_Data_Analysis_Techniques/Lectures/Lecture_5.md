#### 4. Practical Application:
**Case Study Example 1: Drone Fleet Maintenance**
A leading drone service provider implemented predictive maintenance models using sensor data from their fleet of drones. By analyzing vibration and temperature data, they could predict motor failures up to two weeks in advance, allowing for scheduled repairs without disrupting service.

**Code Snippet Example: Simple Predictive Model Using Python**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load historical maintenance data
data = pd.read_csv('drone_maintenance_data.csv')
X = data[['temperature', 'vibration']]
y = data['failure_occurred']

# Create a linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict future failures based on new sensor data
new_data = pd.DataFrame({'temperature': [75], 'vibration': [0.5]})
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
print(predictions)  # Output indicates likelihood of failure
```
