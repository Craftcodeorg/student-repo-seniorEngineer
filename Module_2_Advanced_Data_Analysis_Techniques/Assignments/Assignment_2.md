### Assignment: Analyze Flight Safety Data to Identify Key Risk Factors

#### Problem Statement:
As a data engineer in the aerospace industry, your task is to analyze flight safety data to identify key risk factors that may affect the safety of drone operations. Using predictive modeling techniques learned in the lecture, you will build a model to classify whether a flight mission will succeed or fail based on various parameters such as weather conditions, battery status, and previous mission outcomes. This analysis will help improve decision-making and enhance flight safety protocols.

#### Starter Code:
Below is a basic framework to get you started on analyzing flight safety data. Your goal is to expand this code to create a predictive model using a classification algorithm.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Sample flight safety data
data = {
    'weather_condition': [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],  # 0: good, 1: bad
    'battery_status': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],      # 1: sufficient, 0: low
    'previous_success': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],   # 1: success, 0: failure
    'mission_success': [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]      # Target variable
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Step 1: Prepare your data
X = df[['weather_condition', 'battery_status', 'previous_success']]  # Features
y = df['mission_success']                                            # Target

# Step 2: Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Step 3: Initialize the model
clf = RandomForestClassifier()

# Step 4: Fit the model on the training data
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Step 6: Evaluate the model's performance
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Step 1: Data Preparation**
   - Modify the `data` dictionary to include more realistic and varied flight safety data. You can add more features (like altitude or distance) that could influence mission success.
   - Ensure that your DataFrame reflects a balanced dataset with both successful and failed missions.

2. **Step 2: Data Splitting**
   - Adjust the `test_size` in the `train_test_split` function to experiment with different training/testing ratios (e.g., try 80/20 or 70/30).

3. **Step 3: Model Initialization**
   - You may experiment with different classification algorithms (e.g., `DecisionTreeClassifier`, `LogisticRegression`) instead of `RandomForestClassifier`. Compare their performance.

4. **Step 4: Model Fitting**
   - Add hyperparameter tuning to optimize your model. Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the best parameters for your chosen model.

5. **Step 5: Prediction and Evaluation**
   - After making predictions on the test set, include confusion matrix visualization to better understand the modelâ€™s performance.
   - Analyze the classification report and discuss what the precision, recall, and F1-score indicate about your model's effectiveness.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Accuracy**: The model should correctly classify mission success with a reasonable accuracy (aim for above 70%).
- **Code Quality**: The code should be clean and well-documented with comments explaining each step.
- **Model Performance**: Include a classification report and confusion matrix in your output to demonstrate your model's performance.
- **Analysis**: Provide a brief analysis of your findings. Discuss any insights gained from the data regarding risk factors affecting mission success.

This assignment allows you to apply predictive modeling techniques in a practical context relevant to aerospace and defense while enhancing your coding skills in Python. Good luck!
