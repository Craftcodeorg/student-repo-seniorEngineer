# Module Title: Advanced Data Analysis Techniques

## Exercise Requirements

### 1. Problem Statement
You are tasked with analyzing the relationship between flight hours and maintenance issues for a fleet of military drones. Your goal is to visualize this correlation to identify patterns that could inform predictive maintenance strategies. Using the concepts discussed in the lecture on predictive modeling in aerospace, you will need to create a visualization that clearly depicts how flight hours impact the frequency of maintenance issues.

**Scenario**: You have access to a dataset containing records of drone flights, including the total flight hours and the number of maintenance issues reported for each drone. Your job is to analyze this data and provide insights that could help in optimizing maintenance schedules and improving aircraft performance.

### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load your dataset
# Ensure your dataset has columns 'flight_hours' and 'maintenance_issues'
data = pd.read_csv('drone_flight_data.csv')  # Replace with your actual data file

# Calculate the correlation between flight hours and maintenance issues
correlation = data['flight_hours'].corr(data['maintenance_issues'])
print(f"Correlation between flight hours and maintenance issues: {correlation}")

# Create a scatter plot to visualize the correlation
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(data['flight_hours'], data['maintenance_issues'], color='blue', alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Correlation between Flight Hours and Maintenance Issues')
plt.xlabel('Flight Hours')
plt.ylabel('Number of Maintenance Issues')
plt.grid(True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: Remember that correlation values range from -1 to 1. A value closer to 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, while a value closer to -1 indicates a strong negative correlation.
- **Hint 2**: When visualizing data, consider adding trend lines or regression lines to help illustrate the relationship more clearly.
- **Hint 3**: Ensure your dataset is clean and free of missing values before performing any analysis, as this can significantly affect your results.

### 4. Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Successfully visualize the correlation between flight hours and maintenance issues using a scatter plot.
- Interpret the correlation coefficient to understand the strength and direction of the relationship.
- Provide insights based on your analysis that could inform predictive maintenance strategies for military drones.

Your final solution should adhere to best practices, including error handling for missing data and clear comments explaining each step of your code. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of predictive modeling techniques and their practical applications in aerospace and defense, aligning with your career goals as a lead data engineer specializing in aircraft data systems and analytics.
