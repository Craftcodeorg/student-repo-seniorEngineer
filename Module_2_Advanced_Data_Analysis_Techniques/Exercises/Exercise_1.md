### Module Title: Advanced Data Analysis Techniques 

### Exercise Requirements 

#### 1. Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a predictive maintenance model for a fleet of military drones. The goal is to analyze historical flight data to predict when maintenance should be performed based on flight hours, number of takeoffs, and other operational metrics. You will use regression analysis to identify key factors that contribute to maintenance needs and make recommendations to improve the maintenance scheduling process.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
Below is the starter code that you will need to complete. This code will help you implement a predictive model using regression analysis based on the concepts discussed in the lecture. Fill in the blanks as indicated by the comments.

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Load the dataset containing flight data
data = pd.read_csv('drone_flight_data.csv')  # Ensure this file contains columns: 'flight_hours', 'takeoffs', 'maintenance_needed'

# Define independent variables (X) and dependent variable (Y)
X = data[['flight_hours', 'takeoffs']]  # Independent variables
Y = data['maintenance_needed']  # Dependent variable

# Add a constant to the model (intercept)
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Fit the regression model
model = sm.OLS(Y, X).fit()

# Print the summary of the regression
print(model.summary())

# Function to predict maintenance needs based on flight hours and takeoffs
def predict_maintenance(flight_hours, takeoffs):
    # Use the fitted model to make predictions
    prediction = _______  # Fill in with appropriate function to make prediction
    return prediction

# Test the function with example values
print(predict_maintenance(_____, _____))  # Fill in with example flight hours and takeoffs
```

#### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: Recall that in regression analysis, you need to use the coefficients obtained from the fitted model to calculate predictions. Look at how you can access these coefficients.
- **Hint 2**: When testing the function, think about realistic values for flight hours and takeoffs based on your knowledge of drone operations.
- **Hint 3**: Remember to handle potential exceptions or errors in your function, such as ensuring that input values are valid numbers.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Fill in the blanks correctly to demonstrate your understanding of regression analysis as applied to aircraft maintenance.
- Show how to predict maintenance needs based on flight data.
- Ensure that your code adheres to best practices, including error handling and clear comments explaining each step.

### Integration 
This exercise is designed to reinforce your understanding of statistical analysis techniques relevant to aircraft performance while providing a hands-on experience in predictive modeling. Be sure to review the lecture content for guidance on regression analysis and its applications in aerospace before starting this exercise.
