### Module Title: Advanced Data Analysis Techniques

### Exercise 3: Perform Statistical Analysis on a Dataset of Flight Incidents

#### 1. Problem Statement
You are tasked with analyzing a dataset of flight incidents to identify patterns and trends that can inform predictive maintenance models for military aircraft. The dataset includes various features such as incident type, aircraft model, time of occurrence, and environmental conditions at the time of the incident. Your goal is to apply statistical analysis techniques learned in the lecture to extract meaningful insights that could enhance flight safety and operational efficiency.

**Scenario**: You have been given a CSV file named `flight_incidents.csv` containing the following columns:
- `incident_id`: Unique identifier for each incident
- `aircraft_model`: Model of the aircraft involved
- `incident_type`: Type of incident (e.g., mechanical failure, weather-related)
- `incident_time`: Timestamp of when the incident occurred
- `environmental_conditions`: Weather conditions at the time of the incident (e.g., clear, rainy, foggy)

Using this dataset, you will perform statistical analysis to answer the following questions:
1. What is the frequency of different incident types across various aircraft models?
2. Are there any significant correlations between environmental conditions and the occurrence of specific incident types?
3. What trends can be observed over time regarding incident occurrences?

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('flight_incidents.csv')

# Function to analyze incident frequency by type and model
def analyze_incident_frequency(data):
    # Group by aircraft model and incident type
    frequency_table = data.groupby(['aircraft_model', 'incident_type']).size().reset_index(name='frequency')
    
    # Visualize the frequency of incidents
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.barplot(data=frequency_table, x='aircraft_model', y='frequency', hue='incident_type')
    plt.title('Frequency of Incident Types by Aircraft Model')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.ylabel('Frequency')
    plt.xlabel('Aircraft Model')
    plt.legend(title='Incident Type')
    plt.show()

# Function to analyze correlations with environmental conditions
def analyze_environmental_correlations(data):
    # Create a correlation matrix for environmental conditions
    correlation_matrix = data[['incident_type', 'environmental_conditions']]._____
    
    # Visualize correlations
    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
    sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm')
    plt.title('Correlation between Environmental Conditions and Incident Types')
    plt.show()

# Analyze incident frequency
analyze_incident_frequency(data)

# Analyze environmental correlations
analyze_environmental_correlations(data)
```

#### 3. Hints
- For analyzing the frequency of incidents, think about how to group your data effectively using `groupby()`.
- To visualize the frequency table, consider using `seaborn` or `matplotlib` for creating bar plots.
- When calculating correlations, ensure you convert categorical variables into numerical formats if necessary.
- Use functions like `pd.get_dummies()` to help with converting categorical data before computing correlations.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Fill in the blanks correctly to implement the functions for analyzing flight incidents.
- Generate visualizations that clearly illustrate the frequency of incidents and any correlations with environmental conditions.
- Demonstrate a solid understanding of statistical analysis techniques as applied to real-world scenarios in aerospace and defense.
- Ensure your final solution adheres to best practices in data analysis, including proper error handling and clear documentation within your code.

### Integration 
- This exercise is structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into your learning platform.
- Ensure that all necessary files (e.g., `flight_incidents.csv`) are accessible and linked appropriately for student use. 

This exercise will not only reinforce the concepts discussed in the lecture but also align with your career goals of becoming a lead data engineer in aerospace, focusing on data-driven decision-making and predictive maintenance strategies.
