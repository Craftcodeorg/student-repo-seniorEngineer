### Module Title: Real-World Applications of Data Engineering in Aerospace

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement
As a lead data engineer specializing in aircraft data systems, you are tasked with analyzing drone photography data to assess the terrain for potential flight operations. Your company is planning to conduct a series of test flights in a new area, and you must provide insights on the terrain's suitability for safe and efficient operations. 

Using the concepts learned in the lecture on aerial drone photography, consider the following scenario: 

- You have received a dataset containing images captured by drones over a specified region. Your goal is to process these images to identify potential obstacles, assess land features, and generate a preliminary report on the terrain conditions.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
Below is a starter code that implements basic image processing techniques discussed in the lecture. Your task is to fill in the blanks to complete the functionality.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Function to analyze terrain from drone images
def analyze_terrain(image_path):
    # Load the image captured by the drone
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    
    # Convert to grayscale
    gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise and improve edge detection
    blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray_image, (5, 5), 0)
    
    # Apply Canny edge detection
    edges = cv2.Canny(blurred_image, threshold1=30, threshold2=100)
    
    # Find contours in the edge-detected image
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
    
    # Draw contours on the original image for visualization
    output_image = image.copy()
    cv2.drawContours(output_image, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
    
    # Save the processed image with contours
    cv2.imwrite('terrain_analysis_output.jpg', output_image)
    
    return len(contours)  # Return the number of detected obstacles

# Test the function with an example drone image
num_obstacles = analyze_terrain('drone_image.jpg')
print("Number of detected obstacles:", num_obstacles)
```

#### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: Remember that applying a Gaussian blur can help reduce noise in the images before edge detection. Think about what parameters you might need for this function.
- **Hint 2**: When you are finding contours, consider how you can visualize them on the original image. What function will allow you to draw these contours?
- **Hint 3**: The final output should provide meaningful feedback. Think about what kind of information would be useful for assessing terrain suitability.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
Upon completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Successfully fill in the blanks in the provided starter code.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how to process drone imagery to assess terrain conditions.
- Generate a report on the number of detected obstacles in the terrain, which can be used for flight operation planning.

The final solution should adhere to best practices, including error handling (e.g., checking if the image path is valid), and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step taken in the analysis process.

### Integration
This exercise is structured to facilitate hands-on learning and application of concepts covered in the lecture. Ensure that you review your code for clarity and efficiency before submitting your final analysis report.
