### Module Title: Real-World Applications of Data Engineering in Aerospace

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   You are tasked with developing an algorithm to optimize autonomous flight routes for a fleet of drones used in aerial drone photography. The drones must operate safely while minimizing flight time and energy consumption. Using data from Flight Data Recorders (FDR), weather data, and maintenance records, create a solution that considers these factors to enhance flight safety and efficiency. Your solution should incorporate predictive analytics to anticipate potential hazards along the route.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**: 
   Below is a starter code template to help you implement the algorithm. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality based on the concepts discussed in the lecture.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np

   # Sample DataFrame of flight data
   flight_data = {
       'Flight_ID': [1, 2, 3, 4],
       'Distance': [100, 200, 150, 300],  # in kilometers
       'Weather_Condition': ['Clear', 'Stormy', 'Cloudy', 'Clear'],
       'Maintenance_Needed': [0, 1, 0, 1]  # 0: No, 1: Yes
   }
   df = pd.DataFrame(flight_data)

   # Function to optimize flight routes
   def optimize_flight_routes(df):
       optimized_routes = []
       for index, row in df.iterrows():
           # Check if maintenance is needed
           if row['Maintenance_Needed'] == 0:
               # Calculate optimal route based on distance and weather conditions
               if row['Weather_Condition'] == 'Clear':
                   optimal_time = _______ / _______  # Calculate time based on distance and speed
                   optimized_routes.append((row['Flight_ID'], optimal_time))
           else:
               print(f"Flight {row['Flight_ID']} requires maintenance.")
       return optimized_routes

   # Test the function with the flight data
   optimized_flights = optimize_flight_routes(df)
   print(optimized_flights)
   ```

3. **Hints**: 
   - Consider the average speed of the drones when calculating the optimal time for each flight.
   - Use data from the weather conditions to determine if a flight can proceed as planned or if it needs an alternative route.
   - Think about how predictive analytics could help you identify potential delays or hazards based on historical data.

4. **Expected Outcome**: 
   By completing this exercise, you should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating your understanding of how to apply predictive analytics and optimization techniques in real-world scenarios within Aerospace and Defense. The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling (e.g., checking for invalid weather conditions), and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step.

### Integration
- Ensure that the exercise content is well-structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.
