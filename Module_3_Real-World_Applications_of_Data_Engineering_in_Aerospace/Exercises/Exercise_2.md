### Module Title: Real-World Applications of Data Engineering in Aerospace

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement
You are tasked with developing a predictive maintenance model for military aircraft using flight simulation data. Your goal is to simulate various flight paths based on the collected flight data and analyze how different maneuvers affect the aircraft's performance and maintenance needs. Consider how the insights gained from these simulations could enhance flight safety and optimize aircraft performance, particularly in the context of aerial drone photography.

Using the concepts learned in the lecture, you will simulate flight paths and identify key data points that can be utilized to inform predictive maintenance strategies.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load flight simulation data
data = pd.read_csv('flight_simulation_data.csv')

def simulate_flight_path(data):
    # Calculate the average altitude during the flight
    average_altitude = data['altitude'].mean()
    
    # Calculate the total distance covered using speed and time
    total_distance = _______ * _______  # Fill in the blanks with appropriate columns
    
    # Identify critical maneuvers based on g-force readings
    critical_maneuvers = data[data['g_force'] > 5]
    
    return average_altitude, total_distance, len(critical_maneuvers)

# Test the function with the loaded data
avg_altitude, total_dist, critical_count = simulate_flight_path(data)
print(f'Average Altitude: {avg_altitude} feet')
print(f'Total Distance: {total_dist} nautical miles')
print(f'Critical Maneuvers Count: {critical_count}')
```

#### 3. Hints
- For calculating `total_distance`, think about how distance can be derived from speed and time. Remember the basic physics formula you learned.
- Ensure you reference the correct columns from the dataset for `speed` and `time`.
- When identifying critical maneuvers, recall how g-force readings can indicate extreme conditions that may require additional maintenance or pilot training.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
Upon completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Fill in the blanks in the starter code correctly, demonstrating your understanding of the relationships between speed, time, and distance.
- Analyze flight simulation data to derive meaningful insights regarding aircraft performance and maintenance needs.
- Produce well-commented code that reflects best practices in data analysis, highlighting your ability to integrate theoretical concepts into practical applications within aerospace.

### Integration
This exercise is designed to reinforce the concepts discussed in the lecture while allowing you to apply them directly to a relevant problem in aerospace. The structured format ensures clarity and ease of understanding as you engage with real-world applications of data engineering. 

Make sure to have access to real aircraft datasets or simulated data for a comprehensive analysis experience. Utilize mentorship from aerospace professionals to enhance your learning and ensure your project aligns with industry standards.
