## 4. Practical Application:
### Real-World Example:
In the aerospace industry, drones are used for monitoring aircraft conditions during maintenance checks. For instance, a drone equipped with a thermal camera can inspect an aircraft's fuselage for heat anomalies that indicate potential issues.

### Code Snippet Scenario:
Hereâ€™s a simple Python code snippet demonstrating how to process images collected from a drone using OpenCV to detect edges, which could be useful for analyzing structural integrity:

```python
import cv2

# Load the image captured by the drone
image = cv2.imread('drone_image.jpg')

# Convert to grayscale
gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply Canny edge detection
edges = cv2.Canny(gray_image, threshold1=30, threshold2=100)

# Save the processed image
cv2.imwrite('drone_edges.jpg', edges)
```
