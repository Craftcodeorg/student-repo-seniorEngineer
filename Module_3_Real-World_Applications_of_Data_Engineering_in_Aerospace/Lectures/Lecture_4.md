#### 4. Practical Application:
One real-world example of autonomous aircraft systems is their use in precision agriculture, where drones collect data on crop health and soil conditions. This data is processed to optimize farming practices.

**Code Snippet Example**:
```python
import random

# Simulate sensor data collection for an autonomous drone
def collect_sensor_data():
    altitude = random.uniform(100, 500)  # Altitude in meters
    gps_coordinates = (random.uniform(-90, 90), random.uniform(-180, 180))  # Latitude, Longitude
    return {"altitude": altitude, "gps": gps_coordinates}

# Example of collecting data
sensor_data = collect_sensor_data()
print(sensor_data)
```
This simple code simulates the collection of altitude and GPS data from an autonomous drone, showcasing how data can be gathered for further analysis.
