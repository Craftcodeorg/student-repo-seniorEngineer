# Module Title: Introduction to Data Engineering in Aerospace

## 1. Introduction
In this module, we will explore **Example 1: Building a simple ETL pipeline** as part of our lecture on the Overview of Data Engineering and its Role in Aerospace. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines are essential for processing and analyzing large datasets, which is particularly relevant in the aerospace and defense sectors. By understanding how to build an ETL pipeline, you will be equipped with the skills necessary to manage and derive insights from complex aerospace data, ultimately contributing to improved aircraft performance and safety.

## 2. Code Snippet
Below is a Python code snippet that demonstrates how to build a simple ETL pipeline for processing drone flight data. This example includes error handling and follows best practices for data processing.

```python
import pandas as pd
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def extract_data(file_path):
    """Extract data from a CSV file."""
    try:
        data = pd.read_csv(file_path)
        logging.info("Data extraction successful.")
        return data
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logging.error(f"File not found: {file_path}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error occurred during extraction: {e}")
        return None

def transform_data(data):
    """Transform the data by cleaning and filtering."""
    if data is not None:
        # Remove rows with missing values
        cleaned_data = data.dropna()
        # Example transformation: Filter for flights longer than 10 minutes
        transformed_data = cleaned_data[cleaned_data['flight_duration'] > 10]
        logging.info("Data transformation successful.")
        return transformed_data
    else:
        logging.warning("No data to transform.")
        return None

def load_data(data, output_path):
    """Load the transformed data into a new CSV file."""
    if data is not None:
        try:
            data.to_csv(output_path, index=False)
            logging.info(f"Data loaded successfully into {output_path}.")
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error occurred during loading: {e}")

# Main ETL process
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_file = 'drone_flight_data.csv'
    output_file = 'cleaned_drone_flight_data.csv'
    
    # ETL process
    raw_data = extract_data(input_file)
    transformed_data = transform_data(raw_data)
    load_data(transformed_data, output_file)
```

## 3. Explanation
### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Code:
- **Importing Libraries**: The code begins by importing the necessary libraries, `pandas` for data manipulation and `logging` for tracking the ETL process.
  
- **Extract Function**: The `extract_data` function reads a CSV file containing drone flight data. It includes error handling to manage scenarios where the file may not be found or if other exceptions occur during extraction.

- **Transform Function**: The `transform_data` function cleans the extracted data by removing any rows with missing values. It also filters the dataset to include only flights longer than 10 minutes, which could be relevant for analysis in aerospace applications.

- **Load Function**: The `load_data` function writes the transformed data to a new CSV file. It also includes error handling to ensure that any issues during loading are logged.

- **Main ETL Process**: The script's main block orchestrates the ETL process by calling the extract, transform, and load functions in sequence.

### Real-World Problem Solved:
This ETL pipeline addresses common challenges in aerospace data management, such as ensuring data quality through cleaning and transforming raw datasets into structured formats that can be analyzed for insights. In particular, it facilitates predictive maintenance models by providing clean datasets that can be used to assess aircraft performance and safety.

## 4. Application
In the aerospace and defense sectors, companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin utilize ETL pipelines to analyze flight data from various aircraft systems. For instance, by implementing an ETL pipeline similar to the one above, they can process large volumes of telemetry data collected during test flights. This allows engineers to identify patterns that indicate potential maintenance issues before they become critical, thereby enhancing flight safety and operational efficiency.

By mastering these ETL techniques, you will be well-equipped to contribute to innovative projects aimed at optimizing aircraft performance and developing predictive maintenance models, aligning perfectly with your career goals of becoming a lead data engineer in aerospace.
