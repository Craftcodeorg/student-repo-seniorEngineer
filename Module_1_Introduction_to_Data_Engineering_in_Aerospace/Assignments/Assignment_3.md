### Assignment: Case Study on the Impact of Data Engineering in Enhancing Flight Safety

#### Problem Statement:
In the aerospace industry, data engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing flight safety. Your task is to present a case study that illustrates how advanced data systems can be utilized to improve safety protocols and decision-making processes in aircraft operations. You will analyze a real-world scenario where data analytics has been successfully implemented to mitigate risks and enhance flight safety.

#### Starter Code:
Below is a basic framework for your case study analysis. You will need to expand upon this code by integrating real data sets, performing analyses, and presenting your findings.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Starter code for analyzing flight safety data

def analyze_flight_safety(data):
    """
    Analyzes flight safety data to identify key safety metrics.
    
    Parameters:
    - data: DataFrame containing flight data with relevant safety metrics.
    
    Returns:
    - summary: A dictionary containing key safety insights.
    """
    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of flights
    total_flights = len(data)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the number of incidents
    incidents = data[data['incident'] == True]
    total_incidents = len(incidents)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the incident rate
    incident_rate = (total_incidents / total_flights) * 100 if total_flights > 0 else 0
    
    # Prepare summary
    summary = {
        'Total Flights': total_flights,
        'Total Incidents': total_incidents,
        'Incident Rate (%)': incident_rate
    }
    
    return summary

# Example usage with sample data (students will need to replace this with actual flight data)
sample_data = {
    'flight_id': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'incident': [False, True, False, True, False]
}
flight_data = pd.DataFrame(sample_data)

# Analyze the flight safety data
safety_summary = analyze_flight_safety(flight_data)
print(safety_summary)
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Research and obtain a publicly available dataset related to flight incidents and safety metrics. This could include data from aviation authorities or safety boards.

2. **Data Preparation**: 
   - Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Ensure that the dataset contains relevant columns such as `flight_id`, `incident`, `date`, `aircraft_type`, etc.

3. **Modify the Function**: 
   - Expand the `analyze_flight_safety` function to include additional analyses:
     - Calculate the incident rate by aircraft type.
     - Identify trends over time (e.g., incidents per year).
     - Analyze the correlation between specific flight parameters (like altitude or speed) and incidents.

4. **Enhance Output**: 
   - Modify the output to provide more detailed insights. For example, return a list of incidents along with their corresponding flight details.

5. **Visualization**: 
   - Use Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visual representations of your findings, such as charts showing incident rates over time or by aircraft type.

6. **Documentation**: 
   - Ensure your code is well-documented with comments explaining each step. This will help others understand your approach and findings.

7. **Presentation**: 
   - Prepare a presentation summarizing your case study findings, including visualizations and key insights derived from your analysis.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Accuracy**: The analysis correctly calculates safety metrics and identifies trends.
- **Code Quality**: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices (e.g., proper naming conventions, modular functions).
- **Documentation**: The code includes sufficient comments and documentation for clarity.
- **Visualizations**: Effective use of charts and graphs to represent findings clearly.
- **Presentation**: The case study is presented in a professional manner, highlighting key insights and recommendations for enhancing flight safety through data engineering.

This assignment encourages you to apply the concepts learned in the lecture on aircraft data systems while allowing you to engage with real-world data relevant to your interests in aerospace and defense. Good luck!
